This Python code uses the customtkinter custom library to create a simple calculator GUI. The calculator is displayed in a dark themed window, and the number buttons are displayed in a typical calculator layout, along with buttons for basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. When the user clicks the number buttons, the corresponding numbers are entered into the output field, and when the user clicks the "=" button to calculate the result of the entered operation, the result is displayed in the output field. There is also a "C" button to clear the output field. The code includes a calculate() callback function that is called by the "=" button and uses the eval() function to calculate the result of the entered operation.

### To work correctly you must have installed the customtkinter library: 

pip install customtkinter
